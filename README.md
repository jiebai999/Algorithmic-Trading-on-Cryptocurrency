# Project-2

Introduction
Machine learning is a powerful tool that could be applied to crypto trading in
determining market trends and taking out emotional decision making. However, which machine learning
models is the best to predict market conditions? Our mission is to analyze different machine
learning models' performances to determine which model could make you a crypto trading genius
tomorrow.



Our intentions with this project are to analyze our data using the Random Forest, LSTM,
and ARIMA models to discover the optimal accuracy rate to predict future prices and potential
patterns of cryptocurrencies. With our software, we hope to
gain the confidence and trust to use this model in real-world situations.


We are going to use csv and APIs to pull the data. We are going to apply the following:

-Pandas
-numpy
-hvplot
-Several imports from the sklearn set
-Keras

The machine learning models we will be using in our approach will be:

-Random Forest
-Neural Networks
-LSTM
-ARIMA



We will also be looking into the patterns of Bitcoin vs Gold to help us to diversify.
